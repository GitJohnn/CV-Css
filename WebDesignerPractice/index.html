          <h3>Game Development & Design</h3>
          <p>I Enjoy Coding In The Unity Game Engine. My passion for Making games
             Started Since I was little when I was Introduced to the game Tibia.
             I always wanted to Recreate that Game and make it "Free to Play".
             I took classes since I was 15 years old and my knowledge for Game design
             is an Art I take Pride in.</p>

          <h3>3D Modeling & Simulations</h3>
          <p>I Design 3D Models To Be Used as Game Assets and For Engineering Projects.
             I was Introduced to Blender when taking Game Design courses, I
             enjoyed creating animations and 3D structures. When I got to College
             I was Introduced to SolidWorks and AutoCAD. I Liked Solidworks
             because of the freedom from the software to do multiple things.
             3D modeling is a Skill I am proud of and Enjoy Doing!</p>
